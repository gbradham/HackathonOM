# HACK BETA '24 1st PlaceðŸ¥‡

Under the name "Here For Free Food," our group placed 1st at the University of Mississippi's Hack BETA 2024.

## What It Does
Our Application collects data about the temperature, humidity, and barometric pressure and measures the current environment's threat level, informing the user of it. The user can set a custom range for each reading depending on their environment. These encrypted transmissions allow a user to have real-time information on their environment and alerts to threats.

## How We Built It

We used our smarts, creativity, and anger to connect the provided Arduinos to a website. The statistics are constantly being tracked by a central web server hosted on the OLED Arduino to check their threat levels and update accordingly to the user's device.

## Challenges

Coming into this project, none of our group had experience working with ARDUINO boards. We also lacked coding experience using languages such as Javascript and C++

## Takeaways

Although this was a challenging hackathon, we were able to take our previous knowledge and apply it in a new field in order to produce some software, and our placement proves that we are able to swiftly and efficiently tackle real-world problems.a
